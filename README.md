# Sign-up Form

This is a project from The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form) to demonstrate an ability to incorporate and stylize a form using HTML and CSS. For the project I utilized flexbox to create two halves. The left side features a large graphic of a boxing gym with a header displaying the name of the gym. I used the CSS positioning property to place it at the height I wanted. The right side features the form which uses flexbox within it to display a large hero section with the form sitting below it. Using pseudo classes and javascript event listeners, it's validated as it's filled out.
